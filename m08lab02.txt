a) The difference between STDCALLFastLogHook() and FastLogHook() is that FastLogHook is an python object which sets up hard hook very easily. It also uses assembly stub to execute a hook function. The purpose is that it has to store all register and memory locations by doing that. 

b) Imm.getKnowledge returns a library (or dictionary) of a list. In the list, there are values keyed by it's argument. 

c) The second parameter of the imm.disasmBAckward() displays the number of opcodes are disassembled into the format that people are able to read.
