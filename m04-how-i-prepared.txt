The first thing I've done is that I've read the questions of the module 04 lab.
So, I can understand and analyze about what the questions require and also the output of the program. 

Then, I do check the link "greenteapress" as the lab requires to read some words. 

I've checked the class objectives which are written on the lab as well. The class objectives tell you what goals students must be focus on when they do the lab and I think it is important to check them so, we know what we have to learn.   

Also, as I have lack of understanding some english words and some technical terms, I've checked the meaning of those words. 
I used Google but also the link of "Official Tutorial" which is at our class website. It mostly provides the basics of python programming, so I feel it has various imformation that are useful. 

Then, I start on working each problems with using my knowledge. The first step I usually do is to build an algorithm.
